In this implementation, I have defined the updateVisibleComponent function in the AppComponent. It sets the visible component state to the specified component name.

The HeaderComponent takes a prop setVisibleComponent that is a function to update the visible component state in the AppComponent.

The Component1 component takes the same function as a prop and uses it in the handleButtonClick function to update the visible component state to Component2.

When the HeaderComponent buttons are clicked, they call the setVisibleComponent function with the appropriate component name to update the visible component state in AppComponent.

The renderVisibleComponent function in AppComponent uses the visible component state to conditionally render the appropriate component.

When the Go to Component 2 button in Component1 is clicked, it calls the setVisibleComponent function to update the visible component state to Component2, which causes the Component2 to be rendered.
